## Slides
Day 1 https://kea-alt-del.dk/courses/frontend-elective/5-createjs.php#/

## Day 2, plan
The following is an (on purpose) very loose plan for the day, you decide where we go, and we spend the time needed on each subject/area.

- Pausing the game
- Adding enemies
- Shooting enemies
- Highscores
- Showing the score
 - Either with `new createjs.Text("hi mom", "30px Verdana", "#fff")` or vanilla JS
- Enemies colliding with the player
