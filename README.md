## Slides
Day 1 https://kea-alt-del.dk/courses/frontend-elective/5-createjs.php#/

## Day 2, plan
The following is an (on purpose) very loose plan for the day, you decide where we go, and we spend the time needed on each subject/area.

### TODO
- Pausing the game
- Shooting enemies
- remove bullets when they leave the screen
- remove enemies when they leave the screen
- Highscores
    - `localStorage`?
- Showing the score
    - Either with `new createjs.Text("hi mom", "30px Verdana", "#fff")` or vanilla JS
- Enemies colliding with the player
- Merge conflicts?

### Completed
- Stay within borders
- jshint / eslint / jslint
- Adding enemies
- talk about native apps
